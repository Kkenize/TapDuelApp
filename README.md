# TapDuelApp

Hi everyone, this is Zhejun(KK) Zhang and I am the developer of the game Tap Duel. 
To describe my game in a sentence, I would say that Tap Duel is...
ðŸŽ® A tactical and speed-based duel game built in SwiftUI using Firebase and Game Center!
This is my first completed app project that I've completely made on my own, including the complete sound track for the game. 
The only exception would be the text-style and the win/lose symbols, which I am grateful for being able to find online. 
It's been an amazing experience developing the app over the course of March 2025 and April 2025, and eventually using it for 
my app presentation at the Boston College Arts Festival. 

Below you will find screenshots of my app and a video filmed by me to demostrate the functions currently implemented in my app! 
I hope you enjoy my first app! :) 

I am a Boston College MCAS student in class of 2026. Here is my linkedin page to get in touch!

## Gameplay Demo

## Features
- Cloud Firestore for real-time multiplayer
- **Game Center friend invites** (To be further tested with a paid apple developer account. Right now I have
the code for inviting friends via Game Center written without testing but connecting to Game Center works.)
- Custom animated backgrounds using SpriteKit
- Sketch-style interface and custom music

## Techniques Used 

Lastly, I would like to provide a list of the techniques used in my app. It is the poster I will be using in the Arts Festival.
